## üöÄ Features

- **144 FPS Game Loop**  
  Uses `requestAnimationFrame` to drive a consistent, jank-free 60 frames-per-second animation loop.  
- **Performance Monitoring**  
  Built-in FPS counter and frame-time measurements (via `performance.now()`) to verify no frame drops.  
- **Pause Menu**  
  - **Continue**: Resume game exactly where you left off, without losing timing or state.  
  - **Restart**: Reset score, timer, lives, and bricks.  
- **Scoreboard HUD**  
  - **Timer / Countdown**: Shows elapsed play time or time remaining.  
  - **Score**: Tracks points (XP) earned by breaking bricks.  
  - **Lives**: Displays remaining lives.  
- **Smooth Keyboard Controls**  
  Hold arrow keys (or A / D) to move paddle continuously; release to stop instantly‚Äîno key-spam required.  
- **Minimal DOM Layers**  
  Only a handful of absolutely-positioned elements (paddle, ball, bricks, HUD, menus) to keep repaint/reflow cost low.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Game Loop & Performance

The heart of the engine lives in **`engine.js`**:

1. **`requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop)`**  
   Schedules each frame, providing the highest-precision timing.  
2. **Delta‚Äêtime calculation**  
   ```js
   const now = performance.now();
   const delta = now - lastFrameTime;
   lastFrameTime = now;
   updateAll(delta);
   renderAll();

‚è∏Ô∏è Pause Menu
Triggered by pressing Space.

Overlay DOM element with three buttons:

Continue: Closes overlay and resumes loop.

Restart: Calls resetGame() to reinitialize all state.

Quit (if implemented): Could return to a main menu (future feature).

While paused, the game loop is halted; timers stop, but the overlay itself remains responsive at 60 FPS (minimal repaint cost).

üìä Scoreboard (HUD)
Timer

Counts up from 00:00 showing minutes : seconds played.

Alternatively can be configured as a countdown.

Score

Incremented each time a brick is destroyed.

Shown as a numerical value (‚ÄúScore: 1200 XP‚Äù).

Lives

Starts at 3 (configurable).

Decrements when ball misses the paddle.

When reaching zero, triggers ‚ÄúGame Over‚Äù state.

All HUD elements are simple <div>s with position: absolute; so updates only touch text content, avoiding full-layout reflows.

üìà Performance Tips & Tricks
Batch DOM Reads/Writes
Read all positions/styles first, then apply writes to minimize layout thrashing.

Minimal Layer Count
Only generate brick elements for bricks that exist; remove DOM nodes immediately when bricks are destroyed.

Offload Logic
Heavy calculations (collision detection, score logic) happen in JS objects, not in CSS transitions or animations.
